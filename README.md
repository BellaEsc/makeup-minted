# Welcome to Makeup-Minted!

## Who We Are
We are a group of 5 students in the UC Santa Barbara data science club creating a web service that will help out fellow makeup/skincare enthusiasts!

Our group consists of Christina Nassar (@christinanassar), Hannah Karni(@hannahkarni2), Isabella Escamilla (@BellaEsc), Megan Wong (@megan-sw), and Srinidhi Sathish (@srinidhisathish1).

## Our Project
Our project's goal is to use machine learning to compare cosmetics using publically available ingredient lists and then finding high similarities between products. This will allow users to see if there are any alternatives to a particular product they like -- this can help with finding affordable options or other products to try. 

## Data, Methodology, and Sources
As the project moves along, we will make sure to document our data sources, methodology, as well as educational resources we find particularly useful.

*Enjoy!!*
